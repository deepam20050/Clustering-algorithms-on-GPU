# Clustering-algorithms-on-GPU

Implemented K-Means, DBSCAN and Meanshift clustering algorithms on both CPU (using C++) and GPU (using CUDA) as part of [CSE560 - GPU Computing](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE560) course. Also compared the CPU and GPU code using various performance metrics.
